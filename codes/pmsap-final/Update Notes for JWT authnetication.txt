authentication in ASP.NET Core Web API application using JWT
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Kindly learn about JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication from this URL: https://www.jwt.io/introduction

In order to use JWT based authentication in ASP.NET Core Web API application, you need to
	- Register the authentication services using AddAuthentication method of IServiceCollection (as retrieved from web host builder, WebApplicationBuilder, by "Services" property
	- while registering the same, configure the auth services to provide support JWT based authentication, where the services will check whether a valid JWT token has been provided in the incoming request through Authorization header
	- use the middleware by calling UseAuthentication() method of web host, WebApplication class (before UseAuthorization() call and after UseCors() call)
	- Create a class with a method that will generate a JWT for an authenticated user and return the same to authentication controller

package: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer (version compatible with your .NET version)

In the PMS APP, following changes have been made:
A. Repository library:
----------------------------------
	- a new POCO in the Repository library, by the name "User" has been created (to store user credentials)
	- table mapping (through Fluent API) for User POCO class has been provided in SiemensDbContext class's "OnModelCreating" method
	- Second migration has been added in the Repository to create the users table

B. DTOs library:
-----------------------------
	- a new DTO in the DTOs library, by the name "UserDTO" has been created (for data transfer between layers)

C. ServiceManager library:
------------------------------------
	- a new interface [IAsyncAuthServiceManager] containing methods to register and authenticate an user have been created
	- the same has been implemented in the class AuthAsyncServiceManager class

D. API application:
---------------------------
	- the reference to the package, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer, has been added
	- certain JWT related settings have been added in the appSettings.json file using "Jwt" section
	- the interface "ITokenManager" has been created with a method to create token, in the "Models" folder
	- the same has been implemented in the class JwtTokenManager present in the same folder
	- an new controller AuthController has been added
	- the AuthController methods have been annotated with "AllowAnonymous" attribute, as end user do not need to be authenticated in order to invoke those APIs
	- the ProductController methods haven been annotated with "Authorize" attribute as end user do need to be authenticated in order to invoke those APIs 
	- Jwt based authentication schema has been added through AddAutnetication method and the middleware has been activated by UseAuthentication() method

E. How to test?
------------------
you can test the auth controller APIs for registration and authentication. After successful authentication a token (string format) will be returned to the end user. The end user application has to send the same token with every subsequent request for Product controller actions/APIs, by adding the "Authorization" header with value "Bearer <token>".

1. register an user

POST http://localhost:5221/api/auth/register
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "username": "joydip@gmail.com",
  "password": "Joydip@123"
}

response: the registered user object

2. login

POST http://localhost:5221/api/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "username": "joydip@gmail.com",
  "password": "Joydip@123"
}

response: a JWT token

3. get all products request

GET http://localhost:5221/api/product/all
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json 
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJqb3lkaXBAZ21haWwuY29tIiwiZXhwIjoxNzY0NDc1OTc5LCJpc3MiOiJodHRwOi8vbG9jYWxob3N0OjUyMjEiLCJhdWQiOiJodHRwOi8vbG9jYWxob3N0OjUyMjEifQ.8-xk9MzfpWWNlF448e5ppa6-4TKIXFrcA8YGzmRB71Q

response: all product records
